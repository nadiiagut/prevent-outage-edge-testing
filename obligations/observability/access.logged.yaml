title: Access Logs Complete
description: >
  Every request must produce an access log entry with required fields:
  timestamp, client IP, method, URL, status code, response size, and
  duration. Missing logs impair debugging and compliance.
risk: high
safe_in_prod: true

required_signals:
  - Access log entries
  - Request count (from metrics)
  - Log completeness rate

pass_criteria:
  - Every request produces exactly one log entry
  - Required fields present and non-empty
  - Log timestamp within request duration window
  - Early disconnects still logged

suggested_checks:
  - name: log_completeness
    method: logs

  - name: required_fields_present
    method: logs

  - name: early_disconnect_logged
    method: logs


evidence_to_capture:
  - Sample log entries
  - Log entry count vs request count
  - Missing field analysis
  - Log write latency
