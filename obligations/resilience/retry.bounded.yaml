title: Retry Count Bounded
description: >
  Failed requests may be retried only up to the configured limit.
  Unbounded retries amplify load during outages. Non-idempotent
  requests (POST) should not be retried by default.
risk: high
safe_in_prod: false

assumptions:
  - Retry policy is configured
  - Multiple backends available for retry

required_signals:
  - Retry count per request
  - Backend attempt history
  - Request method (GET/POST/etc)
  - Retry policy configuration

pass_criteria:
  - Total attempts ≤ retry_limit + 1
  - Retries go to different backends when available
  - POST/PUT/PATCH not retried unless explicitly configured
  - Retry budget not exceeded under load

suggested_checks:
  - name: retry_limit_respected

  - name: retry_different_backend
    method: logs

  - name: post_no_retry
    method: http


evidence_to_capture:
  - Request method
  - Retry count
  - Backend IPs contacted
  - Final response status
